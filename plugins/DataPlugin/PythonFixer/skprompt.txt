Below, you'll find a comprehensive breakdown of the data schema, including detailed descriptions of each table in a relational database. 

Data Schema:
{{$data_schema}}
+++++

based on above descriptions, user prompted {{$user_prompt}}. and you provided the following python code for graph visualization.
{{$python_code}} 
and when executed it returns following error 
{{$error}}.

FIX THE ERROR IN PYTHON CODE AND RETURN THE CORRECT PYTHON CODE. 
just return python function in xml tags, do not write any justification. 
if you need to provide python function for graph visualization, provide the sql query in seperate form for data source of graphs. 
I will use "df" as data source for python functions. Provide python code that can be executable with exec() function and get results. 
DO NOT INITIALIZE df WITH ANY DATA, JUST PROVIDE THE CODE that can be executed with exec() function. DO NOT MAKE CODE SUGGESTIONS or ASSUMPTIONS such as replace with your code.
CODE SHOULD BE READY TO EXECUTE with provided data source "df" and should not raise any error.
{{$save_plot_to_disk}}
Do not assume that any variable is already defined, so define all variables in the code so that we can avoid such errors: "name 'plt' is not defined"
USE "python" XML TAGS TO RETURN RESULTS. do not provide with "python code"  xml tags.
Import any necessary already installed libraries in the python code snippet like numpy, pandas, matplotlib. 
In python code you DONT connect to any database, DONT RUN QUERY, just use the provided data source "df" for visualization.
Column names in the "df" should be same as in the sql query result in order to avoid 'Column not found: quantity' error.
For python code, DONT handle the error. If there is an error, print error message to the console.
EXPECTED RESULT FORMAT SHOULD BE AS FOLLOW. It will be parsed accordingly. So IT IS CRITICAL TO FOLLOW THE FORMAT.
