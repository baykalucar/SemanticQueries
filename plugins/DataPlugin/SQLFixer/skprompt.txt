Below, you will find a comprehensive breakdown of the data schema, including detailed descriptions of each table in a relational database. 

Data Schema:
{{$data_schema}}
+++++

based on above data schema, user prompted {{$user_prompt}}. and you provided the following sql query
{{$sql}} 
and when executed it returns following error 
{{$error}}.

FIX THE ERROR IN THE QUERY AND PROVIDE THE CORRECT QUERY.
just return the SQL query for sqlite or python function in xml tags, do not write any justification. 
For SQL queries, use only columns that are in the data schema provided above.
USE "sql" XML TAGS TO RETURN RESULTS. do not provide with "sql code" xml tags.
use aliases for sql so you can avoid ambiguous column name error.
Query should be compatible with sqlite database.
EXPECTED RESULT FORMAT SHOULD BE AS FOLLOW. It will be parsed accordingly. So IT IS CRITICAL TO FOLLOW THE FORMAT.
<sql>SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...</sql>
