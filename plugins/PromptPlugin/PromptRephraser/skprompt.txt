We implemented a sql and python code generator based on database schema and user prompt. 
A large language model deployed and we embed user's prompt into a template and genarate sql and python code based on the data schema provided below, 
but users can not write good prompts so we need to rephrase and guess their intents and rewrite their prompts in a better way.  

Data Schema:
{{$data_schema}}
+++++

Provide a better prompt for the following user input. Do not justify your result, return only generated prompt. 
If you can understand the intent, enrich your rephrased prompt result with a recommended chart or visualization.
{{$query}}
