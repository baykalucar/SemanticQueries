We implemented a sql and python code generator based on database schema and user prompt. 
A large language model deployed and we embed user's prompt into a template and genarate sql and python code based on the data schema provided below, 
but users can not write good prompts so we need to rephrase and guess their intents and rewrite their prompts in a better way.  

Data Schema:
{{$data_schema}}
+++++

Provide a better prompt for the following user input. Do not justify your result, RETURN ONLY GENERATED REPHRASED PROMPT. Do not include any code or SQL keywords in the prompt.
Enrich your rephrased prompt result with a recommended chart or visualization.
Think as a data analyst or data scientist, so that you can understand the user's intent and generate a better prompt.
